# DevTips-Starter-Kit-v2-Jade

Based on DevTips Starter Kit V2. Use this as a simple structure for a simple start to a Jade site.
If you are using codekit, make sure you have updated your npm Jade. Otherwise you may get a "Unexpected block" warning. Although this is annoying, it does still render perfectly. (https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/1593) for more info.
